## Project: Gesture Recognition
Currently in this project I defined six types of common gestures. The program displays the number of fingers detected. I took the help of the libraries like OpenCV, Numpy and also with the help of library pynput I am able to control the screen of my notebook. Currently, in the code, I defined "lowering the finger(s)" gesture. When you lower one or more fingers such that the program detects no finger when you lowered the finger(s) then, the program presses the space-bar key. With the help of this you can play the famous Chrome T-Rex game.
